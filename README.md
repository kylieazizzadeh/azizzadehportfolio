# azizzadehportfolio

Here is a portfolio of relevant coding experiment. It is a compilation of selected projects and homeworks from some of the computer science classes I have taken at Duke. Below, I will explain each project.

Stats_RStudio.pdf:
  This file includes a data science project analyzing Biden's COVID-19 policy approval ratings. It is coded using R Studio. 
  
 Python, Numpy, Panda:
  This folder includes two homework assignments, which demonstrate my coding abilities using Python (Numpy and Panda libraries). One is focused on transforming data, while the other focuses on inferential statistics.
  
 C to MIPS:
  This folder includes a homework assignment, which demonstrates my coding abilities in C and MIPS. In this homework, we coded for a prompt in C, and then converted it to MIPS. 
  
 P4-DNAlink:
  This folder includes a project coded in Java. Here is the ReadMe explaining this project: https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201-public-documentation/p4-dna-linkstrand/-/blob/main/README.md.
  
 P5-autocomplete:
  This folder includes a project coded in Java. Here is the ReadMe explaining this project: https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201-public-documentation/p5-autocomplete/-/blob/main/README.md.
  
 P6-Percolation:
  This folder includes a project coded in Java. Here is the ReadMe explaining this project: https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201-public-documentation/p6-percolation/-/blob/main/README.md

    "The `Star Wars (1977)` film is quite popular, with a median rating of $5/5$. However, of those that left a rating, male users gave it a slightly higher mean rating of about $4.4$ whereas female users gave the same movie a mean rating of about $4.2$.\n",

Conduct a two-sided t test using [`stats.ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) to evaluate this using the sample ratings data. Report your p-value in `q5_1` as a `float` or `numpy.float64`. Interpret your p-value at a significance level of $0.05$ in the **Answer 5** cell. **Moreover, explain the underlying assumptions in your t test in the cell.** You are welcome to consult the documentation of [`stats.ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) to help answering this question.\n",

The alternative hypothesis is then that the fraction of men who would rate `Star Wars (1977)` a $5$ is not $51\\%$. Conduct a two-sided hypothesis test using [`stats.t.cdf`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.t.html) to evaluate this in light of the sample ratings data of male users who rated `Star Wars (1977)`.

    "4. In the sample ratings data, $51\\%$ of women rated `Star Wars (1977)` a $5$. (You are welcome to write code to validate this claim, but you can just accept it as fact.) Therefore, if $51\\%$ of men and $51\\%$ of women would rate `Star Wars (1977)` a $5$, both null hypotheses in 5.2 and 5.3 would be true. If this is the case, why do you observe a different p-value in the two parts, despite the hypotheses under consideration being ostensibly similar? Briefly explain why you observe this difference in the **Answer 5** cell. "

There is a higher chance of a p-value being statistically significant with a larger sample size because a smaller p-value represents there is stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, about three times more men than women ranked Star Wars, so there is a larger sample size, which means that the null hypothesis is more likely to be rejected due to a smaller p-value. Since there are less women who rated Star Wars, the sample size is smaller meaning there is not as strong evidence against the null hypothesis, resulting in a larger p-value in which the null hypothesis fails to be rejected."
